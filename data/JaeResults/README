Final analysis

/----- Observing run information
All masks were observed three times, 10 mins per each time, at two grating settings.

Common:
- Catalog mask used: Tycho, invar > 0, allmask == 0, flux > 0, brickprimary.

2017C-Commissioning Run
Gratings: 270 and 600 lines/mm, default center wavelength. 
BIT: 
	- Bit 1: Standard stars
	- Bit 2: Standard galaxies
	- Bit 3: Not used
	- Bit 4: NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3050, Flat FoM
	- Bit 5: NDM Local depths, N_tot = 3050, Flat FoM
	- Bit 6: NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3050, Redshift dependent FoM. More precisely. Quadratic dependency
	- Bit 7: NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3050, Flat FoM, f_NoZ = 0.5 (rather than 0.25)
	- Bit 8: RF tuned for 2400 deg
	- Bit 9: RF tuned for 3000 deg
	- Bit 10: RF tuned for 3000 deg with an additional gmag cut.
	- Bit 11: RF ?
	# Note that Bit 4-7 corresponds to NDM and 8-11 to RF. RF priority is mutually exclusive whereas NDM has sizeable intersection.
Masks observed:
- st82-1hr
- st82-3hr
- 8h30
(Three masks.)

2017C
Gratings: 600 lines/mm and 8750A and 6450A center configurations. 
BIT: The selections are the same as 2017C-Commissioning except that everything was retrained from scratch with care.
    # - Bit 1: Standard stars
    # - Bit 2: Standard galaxies
    # - Bit 3: FDR targets tuned for 2,400
    # - Bit 4: NDM1, NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3500, Flat FoM
    # - Bit 5: NOT USED
    # - Bit 6: NDM2, NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3500, Redshift dependent FoM. More precisely. Quadratic dependency
    # - Bit 7: NDM3, NDM Typical depths, N_tot = 3500, Flat FoM, f_NoZ = 0.5 (rather than 0.25)
    # - Bit 8: RF1, RF tuned for 2400 deg
    # - Bit 9: RF2, RF tuned for 3000 deg
    # - Bit 10: RF3, RF tuned for 3000 deg with an additional gmag cut.
Masks observed:
- ngc-1-1

- sgc-0-1
- sgc-3-6
(Four masks.)

2018A
Gratings: 600 line/mm grating with 8750A and 6500A.
BIT: The selections are nominally the same as 2017C except the number density model comes from the real dataset.
	- 1: SDSS stars
	- 2: SDSS galaxies	
    - 3: FDR cut as reported in FDR.
	- 4: NDM fiducial. Ndesired = 3000
	- 6: NDM fiducial but U_Gold = 2. Ndesired = 3000
	- 7: NDM fiducial but U_NoZ = 0.5 Ndesired = 3000
	- 8: RF1, RF tuned for 2400 deg
	- 9: RF2, RF tuned for 3000 deg
	- 10: RF3, RF tuned for 3000 deg with an additional gmag cut.
